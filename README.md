# load-balance

The MLOps Load Balancer project is a demonstration of how load balancing can be implemented on web applications. The project showcases a simple web application built using the FastAPI framework, which is containerized using Docker to ensure it runs consistently across different environments. The project uses a Docker Compose file to spin up multiple instances of the web application servers, as well as an Nginx reverse proxy server.

The incoming requests to the web application are routed through the Nginx reverse proxy server, which load balances the requests to the different instances of the web application using a round-robin algorithm. This ensures that no single instance is overwhelmed with requests, leading to improved performance and reliability.

The Nginx reverse proxy server acts as a single point of entry for incoming requests and hides the IP address of the web application instances, providing an additional layer of security. The use of containerization and load balancing also helps to ensure high availability and scalability of the web application.

The MLOps Load Balancer project provides a useful example of how load balancing can be implemented in a production environment, and it can be used as a starting point for building more complex web applications with similar requirements.
